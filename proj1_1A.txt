CS61C Spring 2014 Project 1 Task A Writeup

1. For each of the test image provided in advanced_tests/, which images are not recognized correctly?

Sans_serif_5, serif_5, serif_8 weren't recognized correctly. 


2. For each test image listed in the previous question, What is the difference in "digit distances" between the recognized digit and the digit it is supposed to be (e.g. if a digit 3 is recognized as 8, and 3 has a "digit distance" of 10 while 8 has a "digit distance" of 20, then difference in distances is 20 - 10 = 10).

Serif_8: Digit recognized as 2. 2 has "digit distance" of 20280286. 8 has a "digit distance" of 26396682. Digit difference is 6116396.

Serif 5: Digit recognized as 1. 1 has "digit distance" of 20119602. 5 has a "digit distance" of 29336101. Digit difference is 9216499.

Sans_serif 5: Digit recognized as 6. 6 has "digit distance" of 12939975. 5 has a "digit distance" of 21909957. Digit difference is 8969982.

3. Give a one to two sentence explanation on why you think the images mentioned above are recognized incorrectly.
We think the images weren't recognized correctly because the template images and the incorreclty-matched test images had different fonts so the pixels couldn't match up.
